- Implement cloth and soft bodies interface.
- Implement user mesh collision interface.
- Add fracture/split interface.
- Make Replay compatible with LightUp, Vray, and Thea Render.
- Allow scaling the dialog.
- Saving replay data into groups causes extreme lag. Also when emitted bodies go past end, they all disappear.
- Get emitter and material changes on indigo working.
- CurvySlider spins out of control on exact solver. Also connected bodies flip at particular points if rotation is disabled and alignment enabled.
- Servo joint wobbles back and forth on iterative solver with low number of passes.
- BallAndSocket joint is unstable when limits are enabled.
- Add our own convex decomposition algorithm.
- Add more checkbox options to simulation tab: fullscreen mode, game mode, undo on end, and hide joint layer.
- Get keyboard, mouse, and MIDI working under Mac OS X. Also disable toolbars when active model is nil.
- Add watermark text displaying version.
- Split Simulation into Simulation and SimulationTool.
