##Overview

MSPhysics is a physics simulation tool for SketchUp. MSPhysics uses
NewtonDynamics physics engine by Juleo Jerez in order to produce fast and
reliable physics effects. In many ways the goal of this project is to bring
SketchyPhysics back to life.


## Access

* (Menu) Plugins → MSPhysics → [option]
* MSPhysics Toolbars
